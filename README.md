PAN Kreator bot
===============
PAN Kreator bot is an internet crawler that digs the resources of the PAN Biblioteka Gda≈Ñska and posts interesting results on the Twitter/Facebook.

Bot uses the OAI-PMH API to connect to the pbc.gda.pl and perform a query. Matching record is downloaded, unzipped and converted from djvu to jpg. Finally, the image is posted on the Twitter.
